Data Cleaning:
Raw:
	+ cause_detail has more than 30% missing data
	+ 

External data:
	+ Collected state and total revenue from each dataframe representing each 	year from 2000 - 2016
	+ Transform columns *1000 to match actual revenue
	+ Facing issue with some rows having negative total_revenue


+ Grouped external data by state and summed to get total investments put into the state in the years 2000 - 2016
+ Merged external data into the raw one to get duration along with that
	- There were missing data where some states didn't have outages recorded that year.

Feature Engineering:
+ cause_cat
+ climate cat



Dealing with missing data (Imputation):
* cause_detail = np.random.choice()
	- This may not be NMAR because:
		+ It is unlikely that investigations are still ongoing on the causes
		+ This information isn't exactly sensitive to anyone as it affects a wide group of people in a geographic location.

* duration
	- Using conditional probabilistic imputation
