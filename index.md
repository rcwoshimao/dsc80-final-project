# Introduction

### Motivation

Power outages pose significant challenges to communities, economies, and critical services. While some of such cases are unavoidable due to naturally occuring weather conditions, there are many ways we can help improve the severity of the problem, even potetially prevent possible occurences. 
The resilience of electrical infrastructureâ€”the ability to withstand and quickly recover from faultsâ€”is paramount to ensuring reliable electricity delivery in the face of natural hazards, equipment failures, and other disruptions. 

While customer demand, pricing, and regional weather events are commonly studied in power outage analysis, much less attention is paid to how the **supply-side** characteristics of a state's power gridâ€”including generation capacity, fuel mix, and generator diversityâ€”contribute to its resilience. A robust grid isn't just about weather-proofingâ€”it may also reflect investments in flexible infrastructure, diversified energy sources, and state-level energy planning.

### Project Objective
We investigate the relationship between generation capacity, fuel source diversity, and actual electricity generation (via EIA-860 and EIA-923) with outage frequency, duration, and impact (via DOE outage data). In this project, we examine a few things: 
- Basic examination of outage data
- Do states with more diverse energy portfolios experiences fewer or shorter outages? 
- Are certain fuel sourses associated with better resilience? 
- Creating a prediction model utilizing features described above to predict the duration of an outage. 

### Data

Our main dataset is from ScienceDirect: *[Data on major power outage events in the continental U.S.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182)*. Below are descriptions of the columns we used in the scope of this project.

| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `year`, `month`, `state`                         |  The year and month in which the outage occured |
| `state`                                          |  The state in which the outage occurred |
| `climate_region`                                 | U.S. Climate regions as specified by National Centers for Environmental Information.

Besides the main dataset, we also utilized the *[EIA-860 Annual Electric Generator Report](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/)*, and the *[EIA-923 Power Plant Operations Report](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/)*. Descriptions of meaningful columns are listed below.  
>The survey Form EIA-860 collects generator-level specific information about existing and planned generators and associated environmental equipment at electric power plants with 1 megawatt or greater of combined nameplate capacity. Summary level data can be found in the Electric Power Annual.

<u>ðŸ’¡  The columns have been renamed to `['year', 'state', 'producer type', 'fuel source', 'generators', 'facilities', 'nameplate_capacity', 'summer_capacity']` from the original dataframe, in the original order, for easier access.</u>

>The survey Form EIA-923 collects detailed electric power data -- monthly and annually -- on electricity generation, fuel consumption, fossil fuel stocks, and receipts at the power plant and prime mover level.

<u>ðŸ’¡  The columns have been renamed to `['year', 'state', 'producer_type', 'fuel_source', 'generation_mwh']` from the original dataframe, in the original order, for easier access.</u>

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
## Data Cleaning
### "outage" dataframe 
**Data cleaning**   
We have first renamed our columns for better readability.    
Since we will be focusing on assessing infrastructure resilience by state based on investment and other economic factors, we have dropped many climate or sales related columns, including outage-specific information that correlate to duration, climate conditiojns, demand-side data like total price, sales and customers, and state economy related columns. The remaining columns are listed here. 

```python 
Index(['year', 'state', 'climate_region', 'anomaly_level', 'climate_cat',
       'cause_cat', 'cause_detail', 'duration', 'pc_realgsp_state',
       'pi_util_of_usa', 'population', 'pop_pct_urban', 'pop_pct_uc',
       'popden_urban', 'popden_uc', 'popden_rural', 'area_pct_urban',
       'area_pct_uc', 'yearly_outage_count_bystate',
       'yearly_avg_duration_bystate'],
      dtype='object')
```

Some other small changes we made include: 
- Replacing `state` column with `posta_code`, to be consistent with external dataframe. 
- Dropping columns with `NaN` state and years, since those are crucial to our analysis. 
- Converted numerical columns to numerical, like `duration`, and cleaned the text of `cause_detail` for EDA later.    
**Feature Engineering**   
We created new columns for **state specific total outage counts**, and **annual state-wise average outage duration of outage**. 
The head of the final dataframe can be seen here.

### "capacity" and "generated" dataframe 
We were originally going to using capacity per capita, but this didnt work because there are too many missing population values in state-year population pairs. After doing some research, we decided to engineer the features `capacity_fuel_diversity_index` and `generation_fuel_diversity_index`, by converting the info in our dataframe into **Shannon Entropy**. 

> Shannon entropy is a measure from information theory that quantifies the uncertainty or diversity in a dataset. In the context of energy:
> Higher Entropy: Indicates a more diverse energy mix, with energy production or capacity spread across multiple fuel sources.
> Lower Entropy: Suggests reliance on fewer fuel sources, indicating less diversity.   

While both capacity and generation metrics use Shannon entropy, they capture different aspects:
Capacity Entropy: Reflects the potential diversity based on installed infrastructure. It indicates how prepared a state is to utilize various energy sources.   

Generation Entropy: Represents the actual diversity in energy production. It shows how the energy mix is utilized in practice.    

Research suggests that energy systems with higher fuel diversity are more resilient to disruptions. A diverse energy mix can mitigate the impact of outages in specific fuel sources.  
For instance, a study from the University of Texas at Austin analyzed diversity trends in U.S. electricity generation using Shannon entropy and other indices, highlighting the importance of a balanced energy mix for system resilience.   

We believe including both scores will allow us to have insights into the discrepancies between **potential** and **actual** energy diversity, which may affect resilience and outage durations.
